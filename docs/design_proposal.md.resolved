# Record Label Website Design Proposal

I have analyzed the current live versions of Universal Music Group, Sony Music, and Warner Music (Global & India) to create this tailored design specification.

## 1. Verified Visual Trends (2024-2025)
From my live analysis of the source code, here are the dominant trends:

*   **The "Dark Mode" Standard**: Warner Music India explicitly uses a `theme-color="#000000"` (Pure Black) with white text. this is the modern standard for "cool" regional labels.
*   **Search is King**: Warner Music Group places a *Search* bar prominently on their Artists page.
*   **News Layouts**:
    *   *Universal*: Corporate text list.
    *   *Warner Global*: Rich "Feed" with filters (e.g., "Filter by: Press, Signings").

## 2. Design Recommendation: "The Modern Powerhouse"
I recommend a hybrid approach: **Dark Mode (Premium)** + **Warner's Rich News Feed** + **Universal's Clean Grid**.

### Color Palette
-   **Background**: `Void Black (#050505)` - Slightly softer than pure black.
-   **Text**: `White (#FFFFFF)` headings, `Silver (#A1A1AA)` body.
-   **Accent**: **Electric Blue (#2563EB)** (Inspired by WMG's tech focus).

### Core Layout Structure

#### A. Header (Navigation)
1.  **Artists** (Priority #1)
2.  **Music**
3.  **News** (Rich Feed)
4.  **Careers** (Culture focus)
5.  **About Us**

#### B. Hero Section
*   **Visual**: Auto-playing full-screen video loop (Muted).
*   **Overlay**: "Shaping the Future of Music" tagline.

#### C. The "Artist Roster"
*   **Search Bar**: Prominent and functional.
*   **Grid**: 3-column Card layout with B&W -> Color hover effect.

#### D. News & Careers (Deep Dive Findings)
*   **News Section**: Implement **Tag Filters** (like WMG) to sort between "New Signings" and "Press Releases".
*   **Careers**: A simple text-heavy section with a "Join the Team" CTA, modeled after Universal's clean layout.

## 3. Implementation Plan
We will build this using:
-   **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS ("Void Black" theme)
-   **Icons**: Lucide React

### Immediate Next Steps
1.  Initialize Next.js Project.
2.  Setup Tailwind Config.
3.  Build `Navbar` and `Hero`.
