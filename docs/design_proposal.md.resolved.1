# Record Label Website Design Proposal

I have analyzed the current live versions of Universal Music Group, Sony Music, and Warner Music (Global & India) to create this tailored design specification.

## 1. Verified Visual Trends (2024-2025)
From my live analysis of the source code, here are the dominant trends:

*   **The "Dark Mode" Standard**: Warner Music India explicitly uses a `theme-color="#000000"` (Pure Black) with white text. This creates a cinematic, "VIP" feel that is very popular for modern regional labels.
*   **Corporate vs. Cultural**:
    *   *Universal Music* uses a corporate grid for news ("Financial Results", "Power 100").
    *   *Warner Music* focuses on "Dreams into Stardom" – a more emotional, artist-first approach.

## 2. Design Recommendation: "The Modern Powerhouse"
I recommend a hybrid approach: **Dark Mode (Premium)** + **Warner's Emotional Storytelling** + **Universal's Clean Grid**.

### Color Palette
-   **Background**: `Void Black (#050505)` - Slightly softer than pure black for depth.
-   **Text**: `White (#FFFFFF)` for headings, `Silver (#A1A1AA)` for body text.
-   **Accent**: **Electric Blue (#2563EB)** or **Neon Purple (#7C3AED)** (Inspired by WMG's modern tech focus).

### Core Layout Structure

#### A. Header (Navigation)
Based on Universal & Warner's live menus, your nav should be:
1.  **Artists** (Priority #1)
2.  **Music / Releases**
3.  **News** (Critical for industry updates)
4.  **Careers / People** (Warner features this heavily)
5.  **About Us**

#### B. Hero Section (The Hook)
*Reference: Warner Music India*
*   **Visual**: Auto-playing full-screen video loop of your top artist's music video (muted by default).
*   **Overlay**: Big, bold typeface.
*   **Tagline Suggestion**: "Shaping the Future of Music" (Generic) or "Your Voice, Amplified" (Artist-centric).

#### C. The "Artist Roster" Section
*Reference: Warner Music Group*
*   Don't just list names. Use **Portraits**.
*   **Hover Effect**: Image goes from Black & White -> Full Color on hover.
*   **Grid**: 3 artists per row on Desktop, 1 on Mobile.

#### D. Essential Features (Technical)
1.  **"Featured News" Carousel**: Like Universal's homepage, showing latest signings or press releases.
2.  **Smart Links Modal**: Clicking "Listen" opens a modal with Spotify/Apple/YouTube links.
3.  **Newsletter Signup**: "Join our community" - Essential for fan data collection.

## 3. Implementation Plan
We will build this using:
-   **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (for that bespoke Dark Mode)
-   **Icons**: Lucide React (Clean, sharp industry-standard icons)

### Immediate Next Steps
1.  Initialize Next.js Project.
2.  Setup Tailwind Config with the "Void Black" theme.
3.  Build the `Navbar` and `Hero` components.
