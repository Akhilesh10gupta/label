# Implementation Plan - Record Label Website

This plan outlines the steps to build a premium, "dark mode" record label website inspired by **Warner Music India** (Dark Aesthetic), **Universal Music** (Grid Structure), and **Warner Music Group** (Artist Storytelling).

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Tech Stack Selection**: We are proceeding with **Next.js 14** (App Router) and **Tailwind CSS**. This is the modern standard for high-performance, visual-heavy sites.
> **Asset Requirement**: You will eventually need to provide high-res artist images. For now, we will use placeholders.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Project Initialization [New]
-   Initialize `next-app` with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
-   Install `lucide-react` (Icons) and `framer-motion` (Animations).
-   Configure `tailwind.config.ts` with the **"Void Black"** color palette.

### 2. Core Components [New]
We will build these reusable components first:
-   `Navbar`: Fixed, glass-morphism effect. Logo left, Links right.
-   `Hero`: Full-screen video/image slider with "Fade Up" text animations.
-   `SectionHeader`: Bold typography with a small accent line (Universal style).
-   `ArtistCard`: Portrait image that reveals color on hover (Warner style).
-   `NewsCard`: Minimalist layout for press releases.

### 3. Page Structure [New]
#### [NEW] `app/page.tsx` (Homepage)
-   **Hero Section**: Auto-playing video loop.
-   **Featured Artists**: A horizontal scroll or grid of top 3 artists.
-   **Latest News**: A 3-column grid of recent updates.

#### [NEW] `app/artists/page.tsx` (Roster)
-   **Search Bar**: Prominent top input (Inspired by WMG).
-   **Artist Grid**: Responsive 3-column grid of `ArtistCard` components.
-   **Filter**: Simple "Genre" or "A-Z" dropdown.

#### [NEW] `app/about/page.tsx`
-   **Mission Statement**: Centered, large text.
-   **Team/Labels**: A simple grid layout (Universal style).

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
-   Since this is a visual project, we will focus on **Build Verification**.
-   Run `npm run build` to ensure type safety and proper routing.

### Manual Verification
-   **Responsive Check**: Verify the `Navbar` turns into a Hamburger menu on mobile.
-   **Hover Effects**: Confirm `ArtistCard` transitions from B&W to Color on hover.
-   **Dark Mode**: Ensure no white flashes occur during page loads.
